A repository for learning RUST programming language. I am just a random newbie, so please don't rely on this repository for any purpose.

To me, the to-go book for reference is "Practical Introduction to Rust Programming" (Japanese: 実践Rustプログラミング入門 ([Link](https://www.shuwasystem.co.jp/book/9784798061702.html))), written in Japanese and published in Japan from [Shuwa System](https://www.shuwasystem.co.jp/). This repository will contain some considerable amouont of codes cited or copied from within this book, which is available on [one of the author's GitHub](https://github.com/forcia/rustbook). Please refer to the license of the original codes if you try to use codes from this repository elsewhere.
